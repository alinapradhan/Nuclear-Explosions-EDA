"Analyze the nuclear explosions dataset by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, detect anomalies, and visualize key attributes. Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction to identify the most significant features influencing nuclear detonations. Finally, develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict the purpose of nuclear explosions based on their characteristics, ensuring effective handling of imbalanced data and optimizing model performance."
# Nuclear Explosion EDA

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using Python and Scikit-learn. It involves loading a dataset, preprocessing it, and applying classification algorithms such as Decision Trees or Perceptron to solve a binary or multi-class classification problem
